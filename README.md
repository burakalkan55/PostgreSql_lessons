Introduction

Welcome to my PostgreSQL Data Analysis project! This repository contains SQL scripts and resources I used to analyze various datasets, focusing on job postings and skills in high demand. The goal was to identify top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and optimal skills combinations for specific job titles.

Background

In this project, I utilized PostgreSQL to conduct data analysis on job postings data. The dataset includes information about job titles, companies, required skills, and salary averages. By performing various SQL queries, I aimed to uncover insights about the job market and provide valuable information for job seekers and employers.

Tools I Used

PostgreSQL: For database management and executing SQL queries.
Visual Studio Code: As my code editor, with the SQLTools extension for PostgreSQL.
Datasets: Job postings data including job titles, companies, skills required, and salaries.
The Analysis
The analysis was divided into several stages, each targeting a specific aspect of the job market:


Creating the Database: Initial setup and creation of the database structure.
Modifying Tables: Adjusting tables to ensure data integrity and optimal performance.
Top Paying Jobs: Identifying the top-paying job titles based on average salary.
Top Demand Skills: Determining which skills are in highest demand across job postings.
Top Paying Skills: Finding out which skills are associated with the highest-paying jobs.
Optimal Skills: Analyzing the best combination of skills for specific job titles, focusing on remote work and data analyst roles.

What I Learned
Throughout this project, I gained a deeper understanding of:

SQL Query Optimization: Writing efficient queries to handle large datasets.
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency for reliable analysis.
Insights into Job Market Trends: Understanding the relationship between job titles, required skills, and salary ranges.
